		I was born in Berwyn, Illinois. At the age of 2, my parents moved back to Mexico and started a business to provide for our family. I grew up helping my father in our store. This intrigued my passion about business. Specifically business management. For that reason, I returned to the  United States 7 years ago to study at UVU. I want to someday have my own business and help my community. I have also a passion for web development. I love to create and promote businesses online.
